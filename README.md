# sh2ex
Extracts internal filesystem of Silent Hill 2

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x

### Usage
* Via drag-and-drop (&#42;): drop a disk image onto the .py file
* Via commandline: supply the path to a disk image as the first argument

**&#42;** Drag-and-drop must be supported by your environment, and Python must be set to handle .py files.

### Currently supported versions:
* SLPM-65051 (v1.50)
* SLPM-65631 - Saigo no Uta - Konami Dendou Selection (v1.50)
* SLPM-12345 - E3 Demo (v0.30)
* SLUS-20228 (v1.20)
* SLUS-20228GH - Greatest Hits (v2.01)
* SLES-50382 - Special Edition / The Collection (v1.10)

*SLPM-65098* might be unintentionally supported as well (i.e. not tested since I don't have it), as the executable name and even disc mastering code on *SLPM-65631* matches with it. If you have tested that exact release, please report the results.
